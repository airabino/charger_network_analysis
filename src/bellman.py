    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : NetworkX graph

    source: list
        List of source nodes. The shortest path from any of the source
        nodes will be found if multiple origins are provided.

    weight : function
        The weight of an edge is the value returned by the function. The
        function must accept exactly three positional arguments: the two
        endpoints of an edge and the dictionary of edge attributes for
        that edge. The function must return a number.

    pred: dict of lists, optional (default=None)
        dict to store a list of predecessors keyed by that node
        If None, predecessors are not stored

    paths: dict, optional (default=None)
        dict to store the path list from source to each node, keyed by node
        If None, paths are not stored

    dist: dict, optional (default=None)
        dict to store distance from source to the keyed node
        If None, returned dist dict contents default to 0 for every node in the
        source list

    target: node label, optional
        Ending node for path. Path lengths to other destinations may (and
        probably will) be incorrect.

    heuristic : bool
        Determines whether to use a heuristic to early detect negative
        cycles at a hopefully negligible cost.

    Returns
    -------
    dist : dict
        Returns a dict keyed by node to the distance from the source.
        Dicts for paths and pred are in the mutated input dicts by those names.

    Raises
    ------
    NodeNotFound
        If any of `source` is not in `graph`.

    NetworkXUnbounded
        If the (di)graph contains a negative (di)cycle, the
        algorithm raises an exception to indicate the presence of the
        negative (di)cycle.  Note: any negative weight edge in an
        undirected graph is a negative cycle
