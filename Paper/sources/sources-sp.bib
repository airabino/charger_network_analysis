title = {The rise of electric vehicles—2020 status and future expectations},
journal = {Progress in Energy},
abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are experiencing a rise in popularity over the past few years as the technology has matured and costs have declined, and support for clean transportation has promoted awareness, increased charging opportunities, and facilitated EV adoption. Suitably, a vast body of literature has been produced exploring various facets of EVs and their role in transportation and energy systems. This paper provides a timely and comprehensive review of scientific studies looking at various aspects of EVs, including: (a) an overview of the status of the light-duty-EV market and current projections for future adoption; (b) insights on market opportunities beyond light-duty EVs; (c) a review of cost and performance evolution for batteries, power electronics, and electric machines that are key components of EV success; (d) charging-infrastructure status with a focus on modeling and studies that are used to project charging-infrastructure requirements and the economics of public charging; (e) an overview of the impact of EV charging on power systems at multiple scales, ranging from bulk power systems to distribution networks; (f) insights into life-cycle cost and emissions studies focusing on EVs; and (g) future expectations and synergies between EVs and other emerging trends and technologies. The goal of this paper is to provide readers with a snapshot of the current state of the art and help navigate this vast literature by comparing studies critically and comprehensively and synthesizing general insights. This detailed review paints a positive picture for the future of EVs for on-road transportation, and the authors remain hopeful that remaining technology, regulatory, societal, behavioral, and business-model barriers can be addressed over time to support a transition toward cleaner, more efficient, and affordable transportation solutions for all.}

journal = {Nature Climate Change},
abstract = {Climate change mitigation strategies are often technology-oriented, and electric vehicles (EVs) are a good example of something believed to be a silver bullet. Here we show that current US policies are insufficient to remain within a sectoral CO2 emission budget for light-duty vehicles, consistent with preventing more than 2°C global warming, creating a mitigation gap of up to 19GtCO2 (28% of the projected 2015–2050 light-duty vehicle fleet emissions). Closing the mitigation gap solely with EVs would require more than 350 million on-road EVs (90% of the fleet), half of national electricity demand and excessive amounts of critical materials to be deployed in 2050. Improving average fuel consumption of conventional vehicles, with stringent standards and weight control, would reduce the requirement for alternative technologies, but is unlikely to fully bridge the mitigation gap. There is therefore a need for a wide range of policies that include measures to reduce vehicle ownership and usage.}

They are generally asserted to have GHG emissions, driveability and life cycle cost benefits over conventional vehicles. Despite this, EVs face significant challenges due to their limited on-board energy storage capacity. In addition to providing energy for traction, the energy storage device operates HVAC systems for cabin conditioning. This results in reduced driving range. The factors such as local ambient temperature, local solar radiation, local humidity, duration and thermal soak have been identified to affect the cabin conditions. In this paper, the development of a detailed system-level approach to HVAC energy consumption in EVs as a function of transient environmental parameters is described. The resulting vehicle thermal comfort model is used to address several questions such as 1) How does day to day environmental conditions affect EV range? 2) How does frequency of EV range change geographically? 3) How does trip start time affect EV range? 4) Under what conditions does cabin preconditioning assist in increasing the EV range? 5) What percentage increase in EV range can be expected due to cabin preconditioning at a given location?}

Utility is further affected as the battery wears through life in response to travel patterns, climate, and other factors. In this paper we apply the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Battery Lifetime Analysis and Simulation Tool for Vehicles (BLAST-V) to examine the sensitivity of BEV utility to driver aggression and climate effects over the life of the vehicle. We find the primary challenge to cold-climate BEV operation to be inefficient cabin heating systems, and to hot-climate BEV operation to be high peak on-road battery temperatures and excessive battery degradation. Active cooling systems appear necessary to manage peak battery temperatures of aggressive, hot-climate drivers, which can then be employed to maximize thru-life vehicle utility.}

We find that electrification can substantially lower CO2 and improve air quality and that decarbonization policy can amplify these trends, which yield immediate and localized benefits. In particular, transport electrification can improve ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), though the magnitude of changes varies regionally. However, growing activity from non-energy-related PM2.5 sources—such as fugitive dust and agricultural emissions—can offset electrification benefits, suggesting that additional measures beyond CO2 policy and electrification are needed to meet air quality goals. We illustrate how commonly used marginal emissions approaches systematically underestimate reductions from electrification.}

ABSTRACT = {Plug-in vehicles (PEVs), which include battery-only electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), have steadily grown in sales amidst various incentive programs, but much speculation exists on when PEVs would become cost-competitive without incentives. This research adopts a bottom-up approach for estimation of purchase cost, and total cost of ownership (TCO). Baseline predictions, as well as sensitivity analysis (with more favorable conditions for PEVs) are generated for 2030. Results show that the five-year TCO of some PEVs could be less than an equivalent-sized conventional internal combustion-engine (CICE) vehicle, but only in the more optimistic scenarios where the cost of batteries and motors decrease more rapidly than the baseline prediction, and when combined with either higher gasoline prices or longer annual distance travelled. However, without subsidies or incentives, purchase cost parity between PEVs and CICEs was not realized in any of the considered 2030 scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {The U.S. Department of Energy’s Vehicle Technologies Office (DOE-VTO) supports research and development (R\&D), as well as deployment of efficient and sustainable transportation technologies, that will improve energy efficiency and fuel economy and enable America to use less petroleum. To accelerate the creation and adoption of new technologies, DOE-VTO has developed specific targets for a wide range of powertrain technologies (e.g., engine, battery, electric machine, lightweighting, etc.). This paper quantifies the impact of VTO R\&D on vehicle energy consumption and cost compared to expected historical improvements across vehicle classes, powertrains, component technologies and timeframes. We have implemented a large scale simulation process to develop and simulate tens of thousands of vehicles on U.S. standard driving cycles using Autonomie, a vehicle simulation tool developed by Argonne National Laboratory. Results demonstrate significant additional reductions in both cost and energy consumption due to the existence of VTO R\&D targets compared to predicted historical trends. It is observed that, over time, the fuel consumption of different electrified vehicles is expected to decrease by 40–50% and a reduction of 45–55% for vehicle manufacturing costs owing to significant improvements through various VTO R\&D targets.},

abstract = {The environmental benefits of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are closely related to the driving and charging behavior of vehicle owners. It is often wrongly assumed that PHEV drivers plug-in once per day. Using data from drivers of the vehicles we show this is not the case and that some drivers rarely charge their PHEV. If the vehicle is not plugged-in regularly, the vehicle will drive fewer electric miles and more gasoline miles, thereby losing out on potential emission savings. Analyzing 30-day charging behavior of 5418 PHEV owners using a logistic regression model, we explore the factors that influence driver’s decisions to not charge their vehicle. Several factors play a role in drivers’ decision to plug-in their PHEV or not, including vehicle characteristics and the availability and cost of charging at various locations. Higher home electricity prices, lower electric driving range, lower electric motor power to vehicle weight ratios, lower potential cost savings from charging, and living in an apartment or condo, among other factors are related to not plugging in a PHEV. The findings have important implications in terms of future policy and vehicle design including which PHEVs policymakers should incentivize and what measures can encourage PHEV owners to plug-in their vehicles to help realize the environmental benefits of the technology.}

Drive modes allow drivers to alter their vehicles’ operating characteristics including propulsion energy sources, responsiveness of the steering wheel/accelerator pedal, etc. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) can use energy from a combination of a battery and a fuel source to propel themselves, so drive modes that can shift vehicle propulsion power sources can directly impact energy usage and emissions in these vehicles. This study examines the use of drive modes in PHEVs. We use empirical, on-road vehicle data to explore whether drivers are using drive modes as intended by vehicle manufacturers and to develop a regression model and engine start analysis to quantify the impact of mode usage on PHEV energy efficiency and emissions. We find that incorrect use of drive modes leads to a 15–30% increase in energy usage and higher engine start emissions.}

Relative to conventional FCVs, FCPHEVs seek to achieve fuel economy benefits through the displacement of hydrogen energy with grid-sourced electrical energy, and they may have less dependence on a sparse hydrogen fueling infrastructure. Through the simulation of almost 690,000 FCPHEV trips using geographic information system (GIS) data surveyed from a fleet of private vehicles in the Puget Sound area of Washington State, USA, this study derives the electrical and hydrogen energy consumption of various design and control variants of FCPHEVs. Results demonstrate that FCPHEVs can realize hydrogen fuel consumption reductions relative to conventional FCV technologies, and that the fuel consumption reductions increase with increased charge depleting range. In addition, this study quantifies the degree to which FCPHEVs are less dependent on hydrogen fueling infrastructure, as FCPHEVs can refuel with hydrogen at a lower rate than FCVs. Reductions in hydrogen refueling infrastructure dependence vary with control strategies and vehicle charge depleting range, but reductions in fleet-level refueling events of 93% can be realized for FCPHEVs with 40 miles (60 km) of charge depleting range. These fueling events occur on or near the network of highways at approximately 4% of the rate (refuelings per year) of that for conventional FCVs. These results demonstrate that FCPHEVs are a type of FCV that can enable an effective and concentrated hydrogen refueling network.}

abstract={In order to determine the overall fuel economy of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), the amount of operation in charge depleting (CD) versus charge sustaining modes must be determined. Mode of operation is predominantly dependent on customer usage of the vehicle and is therefore highly variable. The utility factor (UF) concept was developed to quantify the distance a group of vehicles has traveled or may travel in CD mode. SAE J2841 presents a UF calculation method based on data collected from travel surveys of conventional vehicles. UF estimates have been used in a variety of areas, including the calculation of window sticker fuel economy, policy decisions, and vehicle design determination. The EV Project, a plug-in electric vehicle charging infrastructure demonstration being conducted across the United States, provides the opportunity to determine the real-world UF of a large group of privately owned Chevrolet Volt extended range electric vehicles. Using data collected from Volts enrolled in The EV Project, this paper compares the real-world UF of two groups of Chevrolet Volts to estimated UF's based on J2841. The actual observed fleet utility factors (FUF) for the MY2011/2012 and MY2013 Volt groups studied were observed to be 72% and 74%, respectively. Using the EPA CD ranges, the method prescribed by J2841 estimates a FUF of 65% and 68% for the MY2011/2012 and MY2013 Volt groups, respectively. Volt drivers achieved higher percentages of distance traveled in EV mode for two reasons. First, they had fewer long-distance travel days than drivers in the national travel survey referenced by J2841. Second, they charged more frequently than the J2841 assumption of once per day - drivers of Volts in this study averaged over 1.4 charging events per day. Although actual CD range varied widely as driving conditions varied, the average CD ranges for the two Volt groups studied matched the EPA CD range estimates, so CD range variation did not affect FUF results.}

We find national averages of $0.15/kWh for battery EVs and $0.14/kWh for plug-in hybrid EVs in the United States. Costs, however, vary considerably (e.g., $0.08/kWh to $0.27/kWh for battery EVs) for different charging behaviors and equipment costs, corresponding to a total projected fuel cost savings between $3,000 and $10,500 compared with gasoline vehicles (over a 15-year time horizon). Regional heterogeneities and uncertainty on lifetime vehicle use and future fuel prices produce even greater variations.}

abstract = {Lack of charging infrastructure is an important barrier to the growth of the plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) market. Public charging infrastructure has tangible and intangible value, such as reducing range anxiety or building confidence in the future of the PEV market. Quantifying the value of public charging infrastructure can inform analysis of investment decisions and can help predict the impact of charging infrastructure on future PEV sales. Estimates of willingness to pay (WTP) based on stated preference surveys are limited by consumers’ lack of familiarity with PEVs. As an alternative, we focus on quantifying the tangible value of public PEV chargers in terms of their ability to displace gasoline use for PHEVs and to enable additional electric (e−) vehicle miles for BEVs, thereby mitigating the limitations of shorter range and longer recharging time. Simulation studies provide data that can be used to quantify e-miles enabled by public chargers and the value of additional e-miles can be inferred from econometric estimates of WTP for increased vehicle range. Functions are synthesized that estimate the WTP for public charging infrastructure by plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles, conditional on vehicle range, annual vehicle travel, pre-existing charging infrastructure, energy prices, vehicle efficiency, and household income. A case study based on California’s public charging network in 2017 indicates that, to the purchaser of a new BEV with a 100-mile range and home recharging, existing public fast chargers are worth about $1500 for intraregional travel, and fast chargers along intercity routes are valued at over $6500.}

abstract = {Reducing the climate impacts of passenger cars has a high priority on the political agenda, especially in the EU. However, there is disagreement on how this can best be achieved – with battery or fuel cell electric vehicles, or rather with combustion engine vehicles using electricity-based synthetic liquid fuels. To answer this question and to quantify potential environmental co-benefits and trade-offs, this paper introduces carculator, a Python library to conduct environmental life cycle assessments of current and future passenger vehicles. Because carculator is open-source and equipped with an easy-to-use online graphical user interface, it produces context-specific results, deemed more relevant than results otherwise published in more static formats. carculator supports for several powertrains, vehicle size categories and fuel types, for any year between 2000 and 2050, as well as error propagation from input parameters. We demonstrate carculator with an analysis of the expected evolution of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of hybrid vehicles powered by fossil or synthetic gasoline and battery electric vehicles between 2020 and 2050, for all European countries and Brazil, China, India, Japan and the United States. Results show that current battery electric vehicles perform better than gasoline-powered vehicles in 26 out of the 35 countries considered. In the future, electricity-based synthetic fuels show the potential to reduce climate impacts due to the expected massive decarbonization of electricity supply. However, due to their comparatively inefficient supply and use, limited renewable resources represent a challenge and should better be used for other purposes.}

abstract = {Summary Electric vehicles (EVs) coupled with low-carbon electricity sources offer the potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and exposure to tailpipe emissions from personal transportation. In considering these benefits, it is important to address concerns of problem-shifting. In addition, while many studies have focused on the use phase in comparing transportation options, vehicle production is also significant when comparing conventional and EVs. We develop and provide a transparent life cycle inventory of conventional and electric vehicles and apply our inventory to assess conventional and EVs over a range of impact categories. We find that EVs powered by the present European electricity mix offer a 10\% to 24\% decrease in global warming potential (GWP) relative to conventional diesel or gasoline vehicles assuming lifetimes of 150,000 km. However, EVs exhibit the potential for significant increases in human toxicity, freshwater eco-toxicity, freshwater eutrophication, and metal depletion impacts, largely emanating from the vehicle supply chain. Results are sensitive to assumptions regarding electricity source, use phase energy consumption, vehicle lifetime, and battery replacement schedules. Because production impacts are more significant for EVs than conventional vehicles, assuming a vehicle lifetime of 200,000 km exaggerates the GWP benefits of EVs to 27\% to 29\% relative to gasoline vehicles or 17\% to 20\% relative to diesel. An assumption of 100,000 km decreases the benefit of EVs to 9\% to 14\% with respect to gasoline vehicles and results in impacts indistinguishable from those of a diesel vehicle. Improving the environmental profile of EVs requires engagement around reducing vehicle production supply chain impacts and promoting clean electricity sources in decision making regarding electricity infrastructure.},

Considering the European Union, light duty vehicles are responsible for roughly 10% of total energy use and air emissions. As a consequence, the need for higher fuel/energy efficiency in both conventional and electric cars has become urgent and the efforts across industrial and research players have proposed a range of innovative solutions with great potential. This study presents a comparative Life Cycle Assessment of Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and electric vehicles. The analysis follows a “from cradle-to-grave” approach and it captures the whole Life-Cycle (LC) of the car subdivided into production, use and End-of-Life stages. The inventory is mainly based on primary data and the assessment takes into account a wide range of impact categories to both human and eco-system health. The eco-profile of the different vehicle configurations is assessed and the main environmental hotspots affecting conventional and electric cars are identified and critically discussed. The dependence of impacts on LC mileage is investigated for both propulsion technologies and the break-even point for the effective environmental convenience of electric car is determined considering several use phase electricity sources. The analysis is completed with a comparison of GHG emissions with the results of previous LCA studies.}

We present a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) based on a novel integrated vehicle simulation framework, which allows for consistency in vehicle parameter settings and consideration of future technological progress. Conventional and hybrid gasoline, diesel and natural gas cars as well as battery and fuel cell electric vehicles (BEV and FCV) are analyzed, taking into account electricity and hydrogen production chains from fossil, nuclear and renewable energy resources. Our results show that a substantial mitigation of climate change can be obtained with electric passenger vehicles, provided that non-fossil energy resources are used for electricity and hydrogen production. However, in terms of other environmental burdens such as acidification, particulate matter formation, and toxicity, BEV may in some cases and FCV are likely to perform worse than modern fossil fueled cars as a consequence of emissions along vehicle and fuel production chains. Therefore, the electrification of road transportation should be accompanied by an integration of life cycle management in vehicle manufacturing chains as well as energy and transport policies in order to counter potential environmental drawbacks.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study uses the life cycle assessment (LCA) method to calculate and compare the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and conventional gasoline internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) in 2010, 2014 and 2020 under different scenarios, including different electricity mixes, electricity generation technologies and combined heat and power (CHP) scales, as well as discusses the GHG emission reduction potential of BEVs throughout their life cycle.
Methods
The LCA system boundaries, including the vehicle cycle and the fuel cycle, are examined in accordance with the ISO 14040/14044 standards. The China Automotive Life Cycle Database (CALCD), which is the first and primary life cycle database of the China automotive industry, was used. The compositional data for the vehicle components and the battery material were obtained from the GREET2 2017 model.
Results and discussion
As the electricity mix is optimized, the electricity generation technology is advanced, and the CHP scale is increased from 2010 to 2020, the total life cycle GHG reduction potential of BEVs will gradually improve, reaching 13.4% in 2020, relative to ICEVs.
Conclusions
The sensitivity analysis shows that the GHG emissions from electricity, the percentage of fossil fuel in the electricity mix and the electricity consumption of the BEV during use are important parameters influencing the GHG emission reduction potential of BEVs. By adjusting the electricity mix, advancing electricity generation technologies and increasing the CHP scale, the GHG emission reduction potential of BEVs can be improved.}

We investigate factors associated with the choice to replace a BEV or a PHEV with a PHEV, BEV, or conventional vehicle using survey responses from 1,446 PEV adopters. Most BEV adopters’ replacement choices are a newer BEV, for around 1/10th the replacement is a PHEV, and around ¼ replace their BEV with a conventional vehicle. PHEV adopters’ replacement choices are split more evenly between BEVs, PHEVs, or conventional vehicles. Replacement choices are correlated with vehicle attributes (e.g., range), satisfaction with vehicle attributes (e.g., charging convenience), home charging access, gas price, demographics, and attitudes toward technology, the environment and travel.}

To compare the characteristics, preferences, and motivations of Pioneers and Potential Early Mainstream buyers, we draw data from the Canadian Plug-in Electric Vehicle Study, a three-part mixed-mode survey with samples of PEV owners (n=94) and conventional new vehicle buyers (n=1754). We identify several significant differences in household characteristics, including income, education, and recharge access. In terms of preferences, Pioneers express extremely high valuation of PEVs and prefer pure battery electric vehicle (BEV) designs over plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV) designs. In contrast, Potential Early Mainstream respondents prefer PHEVs. Both Pioneer and Potential Early Mainstream respondents are similarly cautious about controlled charging programs, but Pioneers place five times as much value on using electricity generated from renewable sources than the Potential Early Mainstream. Pioneers also tend to have different motivations, including significantly higher levels of environmental concern, and higher engagement in environment- and technology-oriented lifestyles. Policymakers, automakers, and electric utilities that anticipate a transition to electric mobility ought to consider how potential future PEV buyers may differ in their vehicle preferences, usage and motivations relative to current PEV owners.}

However, researchers are still learning about who is currently using these technologies (“realized demand”) and who is interested in future usage (“latent demand”). We explore these patterns via a representative survey including three of Canada's largest metropolitan regions: Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal (n = 3658, June 2020). Realized demand is assessed as respondents who use or own the technology (pre-pandemic), while latent demand is assessed as respondents who report interest in using the technology (post-pandemic). For most technologies, latent demand is higher than realized demand, indicating the potential for market growth. Exceptions are ride-hailing and pooled ride-hailing in Toronto and Montreal, where latent demand is lower, likely due to concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is regional variation in realized and latent demand for shared mobility: ride-hailing usage is highest in Toronto and car-sharing usage and interest are highest in Vancouver (each corresponding to regional availability). Further, latent demand for electric vehicles and fully automated electric vehicles are highest in Montreal. Otherwise, latent demand levels for the remining technologies are similar across regions. Regression models indicate that latent demand for each technology is associated with respondents' travel patterns, demographics, values, lifestyles, and environmental concern. Regional effects hold in descriptive and regression analyses, for example higher car-sharing latent demand among Vancouver respondents and higher electric vehicle latent demand among Montreal residents, suggesting regional context plays a role in explaining latent demand.}

abstract = {The market for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) --including both battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs)--has been rapidly growing in California for the past few years. Given the targets for PEV penetration in the state, it is important to have a better understanding of the pattern of technology diffusion and the factors that are driving the process. Using spatial analysis and Poisson count models we identify the importance of a neighborhood effect (at home locations) and a workplace effect (at commute destinations) in supporting the diffusion of PEV technology in California between 2014 and 2016. In the case of new BEV sales, we find that exposure to one additional BEV or PHEV within a 1-mile radius of a census block group centroid is associated with a 0.2% increase in BEV sales in the block group. Interestingly, for new PHEV sales- the neighborhood effect of BEV sales is negative, suggesting that enhanced exposure to this type of technology (which is differentiated in distinctive ways from PHEVs) may impact new PHEV sales through a substitution effect. Specifically, higher BEV concentration in an area can have an overall negative effect on new PHEV sales. While the neighborhood effect at residential locations is important, a workplace effect also has a notably important influence on new PEV sales. Both effects work in combination with socioeconomic, demographic, policy, and built environment factors in encouraging PEV adoption. These results, insightful not just for California but other regions in early phases of the PEV market, suggest that policymakers should consider targeted programs and investments that can attract a wider group of early adopters (in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and spatial location) to boost the impact of neighborhood and workplace effects on PEV sales.}

Our results show that socioeconomic characteristics are strong predictors of the car portfolio. Battery electric vehicle (BEV) ownership is increasing in wealth, income and education. While early BEV owners differed from other car owners, over time BEV owners have become more similar to other car owners. We document a strong association between BEV privileges on the travel to work (like toll road exemptions and bus lane access) and BEV ownership. We show that BEV buyers are less likely than other car buyers to sell their old car, but this difference has diminished over time.}

This study uses data from 36,000 public posts on Facebook to investigate intersectionality in EV-communication as per the Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental (PESTLE) categories. A computational social science methodology was adopted using a mixed-method application of social network analysis and machine learning-based topic modelling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm on a 600,000-text corpus extracted from the Facebook posts. Results showed that political, economic, and legal posts had dense clusters around the technology policy of EV, the institutional discourse of electrification of the federal vehicle fleet, and tax and credit framework politics. The environmental and social dimensions had a higher discourse for social justice, clean air, and better health and well-being. A market shift towards EV as a service industry was observed in the technology and economics-related posts. These findings can help policymakers, and planners design contextualised energy policy for influencing EV adoption in the U.S. and other countries.}

The primary objectives of this study are to better understand the role of social (in this case, political) identity in symbolic attribute perceptions, and how these variables work together to influence EV adoption intentions. Among 545 survey respondents from the state of Ohio in the United States, Democrats are more willing to adopt EVs than Republicans. This relationship is mediated by symbolic attribute perceptions. Specifically, Democrats have stronger EV symbolic attribute perceptions than Republicans, and these perceptions predict adoption intentions. Using an identity framework, this study advances our understanding of the psychological mechanisms that help explain differences in EV adoption intent amongst U.S. Democrats vs. Republicans, and offers guidance for targeted marketing efforts to enhance EV uptake.}

Although our findings confirm EV ownership and mobility patterns in general are related to income—those with higher incomes both own more EVs and drive more generally—they also confirm that interest in EVs is not so strongly related. Lower income groups seem to ask less from their cars, thus potentially opening up a market for cheaper low-range alternates. Political orientation is correlated to car and EV ownership, with those on the “left” more interested yet those on the “right” more able and willing to buy expensive cars. Moreover, we see variation in preferences across urban and rural subcategories, and our findings strongly suggest that EVs need not be promoted only for city or suburban areas. When controlling for variables, a multilevel regression analysis does not change the overall thrust of these associations.}

It focuses on literature relating to consumer preferences for charging infrastructure, and how consumers interact with and use this infrastructure. This includes studies that use questionnaire surveys, interviews, modelling, GPS data from vehicles, and data from electric vehicle charging equipment. These studies indicate that the most important location for PEV charging is at home, followed by work, and then public locations. Studies have found that more effort is needed to ensure consumers have easy access to PEV charging and that charging at home, work, or public locations should not be free of cost. Research indicates that PEV charging will not impact electricity grids on the short term, however charging may need to be managed when the vehicles are deployed in greater numbers. In some areas of study the literature is not sufficiently mature to draw any conclusions from. More research is especially needed to determine how much infrastructure is needed to support the roll out of PEVs. This paper ends with policy implications and suggests avenues of future research.}

In addition, the importance of the incentives and their associated effect on purchase behavior has been changing over time: respondents are less likely to not change their decision and more likely to not buy a vehicle at all as time passes and the technology moves away from early adopters.

Reoccurring and non-financial incentives include special lane access for PEVs (e.g. HOV/carpool lanes, bus lanes), parking incentives, charging infrastructure development, road toll fee waivers, and licensing incentives. They also include disincentives such as gasoline tax or annual vehicle taxes. The impact of these incentives differs between regions partially due to differences in traffic conditions, travel patterns, consumer preferences, and other local variations. Due to these differences, it is challenging to rank the importance of these incentives, however existing research shows that they all can have a positive impact on PEV adoption. Policymakers wishing to promote the introduction of PEVs will need to consider local travel patterns, the regulatory environment, and consumer preferences to determine the most viable policy interventions for their region.}

The actual adoption rate however of BEVs in Germany remains low, and strategies for enhancing BEV acceptance are required. Providing direct experience can, for instance, help to overcome prejudices relating to relatively new products, with this being a potential marketing strategy. The present research contributes to the question of what role direct experience plays in acceptance of BEVs. Two studies were conducted to address the relationship between these variables: (1) an online survey (N=286) and (2) a 24-h field test (N=30). Both studies showed several experience-based differences in evaluations of BEV attributes, attitude and purchase intention, with most BEV attributes being evaluated more positively when people had BEV experience. Path analyses revealed a direct experience effect on purchase intention in the online study. Findings from the 24-h field test, showed effects of BEV experience on BEV attributes and attitudes, but no BEV experience effect for purchase intention was found. Based on the results of both studies, we can conclude that practical (and also short-term) experience with BEVs has the potential to change the evaluation of BEVs and psychological factors relevant for determining behavioral intention. As many effects were positive, providing short-term BEV experience to enhance acceptance has the potential to change BEV evaluation as well as the satisfaction with such a vehicle and might be a promising strategy for promoting BEVs.}

We surveyed adult drivers in large US cities in early fall 2011, before vehicle manufacturers and dealers began marketing campaigns. The survey responses thus document early impressions of this transport technology. We find that, given current battery technology and public perceptions, overall stated intent to purchase or lease electric vehicles is low. Interest in plug-in hybrid technology is somewhat greater than interest in all-electric technology. Consumers who express early interest in adopting electric vehicles are typically highly educated, previous owners of conventional hybrids, environmentally sensitive, and concerned about dependence on foreign oil. Enhanced fuel economy, the primary tangible advantage of plug-in technology, is recognized as favorable by respondents but fails to exert a strong influence on purchasing intentions. Interest in plug-in electric vehicles is shaped primarily by consumers’ perceptions of electric vehicle disadvantages.}

This study is a systematic overview of peer-reviewed journal articles to identify the reasons for and against consumer intentions to adopt BEVs. A total of 1846 papers were retrieved and after a two-step identification, 40 papers were finally identified and analyzed in detail. The influencing factors were categorized into three main types, namely demographic, situational and psychological, and they were reviewed separately. In addition, the shortcomings and deficiencies in the current studies were also noted.}

In this paper, we analyse and discuss several empirical data sets from Germany, characterising this user group from both a user and a product perspective, i.e. who is willing to buy an EV and who should buy one. Our results show that the most likely group of private EV buyers in Germany are middle-aged men with technical professions living in rural or suburban multi-person households. They own a large share of vehicles in general, are more likely to profit from the economical benefits of these vehicles due to their annual vehicle kilometres travelled and the share of inner-city driving. They state a higher willingness to buy electric vehicles than other potential adopter groups and their higher socio-economic status allows them to purchase EVs. In contrast to this, inhabitants of major cities are less likely to buy EVs since they form a small group of car owners in general, their mileage is too low for EVs to pay off economically and they state lower interest and lower willingness to pay for EVs than other groups. Our results indicate that transport policy promoting EVs should focus on middle-aged men with families from rural and sub-urban cities as first private EV buyers.}

A major barrier is that consumers tend to resist new technologies that are considered alien or unproved, thus, policy decisions that consider their critical concerns will have a higher level of success. This research identifies potential socio-technical barriers to consumer adoption of EVs and determines if sustainability issues influence consumer decision to purchase an EV. This study provides valuable insights into preferences and perceptions of technology enthusiasts; individuals highly connected to technology development and better equipped to sort out the many differences between EVs and CVs. This group of individuals will likely be early adopters of EVs only if they perceive them to be superior in performance compared to CVs. These results can guide policymakers in crafting energy and transportation policy. It can also provide guidance to EV engineers' decision in incorporating consumer preference into EV engineering design.}

Although much research has focused on the reasons for, and barriers to, initial PEV purchase, less has been devoted to the reasons for discontinuance—abandoning a new technology after first purchasing it. Here, on the basis of results from five questionnaire surveys, we find that PEV discontinuance in California occurs at a rate of 20% for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle owners and 18% for battery electric vehicle owners. We show that discontinuance is related to dissatisfaction with the convenience of charging, having other vehicles in the household that are less efficient, not having level 2 (240-volt) charging at home, having fewer household vehicles and not being male.}

We identified socio-demographic (gender and age), vehicle characteristics, commute behavior, and workplace charging availability as significant factors related to the choice of charging location.}

abstract = {The Chinese Government has introduced numerous policy incentives to promote the development and adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), especially aggressive subsidization policies. Stimulated by such policies, sales of EVs exceeded 500,000 in 2016. However, the subsidies for EVs will be abrogated after 2020. In order to maintain market stability, the EV-related policy system needs innovation. Nonetheless, it is still unclear how effective different policy incentives are. By conducting a discrete choice experiment involving 247 respondents and using a mixed logit model, this paper investigates the effectiveness of several potential policy incentives except subsidization policies, as well as the influence of socio-psychologist determinants. The results help to offer suggestions for the EV-related policy reformation. As expected, the probability of stated EV-acceptance increases if policy incentives are provided in the choice experiment. EVs are exempted from purchase restrictions (license plate control policy) and driving restrictions in China, and these two transport policy incentives have the most significant positive effects on the EV-acceptance. Discounted/free electric charging also has great contribution. Preferential bus lane access gains increasing attention. Vehicle purchase tax exemption should be resumed because of its positive influence. Comparatively speaking, the financial incentives (e.g., reduced parking fees) in the EV using stage play a weaker role.}

Using a national conjoint survey (N = 2170 respondents), we quantify how U.S. vehicle buyers value different features of PEV financial incentives. Participants overwhelmingly prefer immediate rebates, on average valuing them by $580, $1450, and $2630 more than sales tax exemptions, tax credits, or tax deductions, respectively. These effects are significantly larger for lower-income households, used vehicle buyers, and buyers with lower budgets. We estimate that on average $2 billion could have been saved if the federal subsidy available between 2011 and 2019 were delivered as an immediate rebate instead of a tax credit, or $1440 per PEV sold. Our results suggest that structuring incentives as immediate rebates would deliver a greater value to customers and would be more equitably distributed compared to the current tax credit scheme.}

Self-reported evidence provided by CVRP participants provides a unique opportunity to examine the influence of the incentive from the consumer perspective. With evidence from a voluntary survey offered to all individual CVRP participants, this inquiry used logistic regression to examine the relationship between consumer factors and the influence of CVRP on consumers’ acquisition decisions. In other words, would they have purchased their vehicle without the rebate? This initial analysis examined a set of consumers who adopted plug-in hybrid electric vehicles between fall 2012 and spring 2015 (n = 7,345). Factors considered for inclusion encompassed transaction, household, and demographic characteristics, motivations for adopting plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and measures of experience with plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Findings indicated, as expected, that several characteristics and experiences are associated with a greater likelihood that a consumer would consider the rebate essential. These characteristics and experiences include having lower household income, being younger, adopting less-expensive vehicles, being more motivated to adopt a PEV by a desire to save money, being less motivated to adopt a PEV by a desire to reduce environmental impact, and reporting a lower initial interest level in adopting a PEV. Less straightforward, but informative, results included a positive association between rebate influence and identification with a nonwhite ethnicity or as male. Additionally, the lack of significance of some predictors was unexpected; in particular, no housing characteristics were associated with the influence of the rebate. }

abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are in an early stage of market entry. Nevertheless, there are now more than 2 million PEVs in use globally. PEVs result in lower energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and urban air pollution compared to internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). For these reasons policy makers are eager to see PEVs purchased by consumers in larger numbers. Many policy makers have introduced financial purchase incentives to nurture the growth of PEV markets. These incentives range in value from around US$2500 to US$20,000 per vehicle. There are several studies that either directly consider the effectiveness of purchase incentives or at least include analysis of these incentives as part of a larger study. The results of these studies have not been assimilated in one place to gain an understanding of whether purchase incentives are effective in promoting PEV sales. This means that how effective these incentives are in increasing PEV sales is not well understood. This paper systematically reviews the literature with the aim of understanding purchase incentives effectivity in increasing PEV sales. In doing so this paper builds a deeper understanding of purchase incentives. This in-depth understanding allows recommendations to be made on how to design purchase incentives so that they are most effective in promoting PEV market growth. Incentives should be applied when someone is buying a PEV, not afterwards. Incentives should promote BEVs and PHEV with high electric ranges more than PHEVs with low electric ranges. VAT and purchase tax exemptions for PEVs are most effective. Incentives should not be available on high-end BEVs, education and awareness campaigns should promote incentives to consumers. Finally, the premature removal of incentives could negatively affect PEVs therefore incentives should be designed with longevity in mind.}

One likely reason for this is strong incentives for promoting purchase and ownership of BEVs. The purpose of this study is to describe the role of incentives for promoting BEVs, and to determine what incentives are critical for deciding to buy a BEV and what groups of buyers respond to different types of incentives. The questions are answered with data from a survey among nearly 3400 BEV owners in Norway. Exemptions from purchase tax and VAT are critical incentives for more than 80% of the respondents. This is very much in line with previous research, which suggests that up-front price reduction is the most powerful incentive in promoting EV adoption. To a substantial number of BEV owners, however, exemption from road tolling or bus lane access is the only decisive factor. Analyses show that there are clear delineations between incentive groups, both in terms of age, gender, and education. Income is a less prominent predictor, which probably results from the competitive price of BEVs in the Norwegian market. Perhaps most interesting is the assumed relation between incentives and character of transport systems the respondents engage in.}

Existing studies on consumer preferences for EVs in China have generally focused on first-tier cities, while little attention has been paid to the lower tier cities. This exploratory study investigates consumer preferences for EVs in lower tier cities of China, by collecting stated preference (SP) data in two second-tier cities and three third-tier cities in the south Jiangsu region of China. The discrete choice modeling analysis shows that Chinese consumers in lower-tier cities are generally sensitive to monetary attributes, charging service and driving range of EVs. They also perceive Chinese vehicle brands to be disadvantaged compared with European brands. When comparing the differences in second-tier versus third-tier cities, we find that consumers in third-tier cities are more sensitive to purchase price, subsidy of purchase, and coverage of charging stations than their second-tier counterparts. This study also highlights the role of different psychological effects, such as symbols of car ownership, normative-face influence, and risk aversion, in shaping consumer preferences for EVs in lower-tier cities of China. Our results provide important implications for contextualizing government policies and marketing strategies in line with the different sizes and characteristics of the cities in China.}

EV-supportive policies, including financial incentives and convenience measures, are discussed, and a variable instrumental strategy is applied to solve the endogenous problem of charging facilities. The results reveal that in the public domain, financial subsidies can effectively promote the use of electric buses; however, the adoption of commercial EVs is mainly stimulated by charging facility construction and increasing fuel prices. Meanwhile, in the private domain, convenience measures, such as charging station construction and non-purchase limitations, contribute to increasing the demand for EVs, while the effect of financial incentives is not as significant as we expected.}

In this article, we use machine learning based classifiers to reveal insights about consumer charging behavior in 72 detected languages including Chinese. We investigate 10 years of consumer reviews in East and Southeast Asia from 2011 to 2021 to enable infrastructure evaluation at a larger geographic scale than previously available. We find evidence that charging stations at government locations result in higher failure rates with consumers compared to charging stations at private points of interest. This evidence contrasts with predictions in the U.S. and European markets, where the performance is closer to parity. We also find that networked stations with communication protocols provide a relatively higher quality of charging services, which favors policy support for connectivity, particularly for underserved or remote areas.}

Optimal locations of such facilities are where BEV drivers have easy access to charging where drivers will not have to make any deviation from their pre-planned trips. Such optimally located corridor DCFCs are usually in remote, underserved communities and immediately next to a highway where they lack the advantages of shared utility infrastructure in an urban setting. Therefore, we find that other studies and industry knowledge of infrastructure investments do not apply to corridor DCFC locations. This study evaluates the full project costs of installing and commissioning 54 DC Fast Chargers in 36 sites located in major transportation corridors in California and finds significant variation in costs between them. While existing studies show costs ranging from $20,000 - $150,000, we find costs range anywhere between $122,000 and $440,000. This data is critical for new investment in the U.S. to construct a national charging network of DC Fast charging corridors. We find that a significant proportion of the full project costs are taken up by on site “make-ready infrastructure” costs that vary greatly due to site-specific factors and design choices. DCFC installations should be considered civil construction projects with significant electrical infrastructure planning and installation that requires the cooperation of many local stakeholders. We find that costs can be greatly reduced by working with local electrical utilities early in the design and site selection stages when possible. Our study finds that some cost shift towards utility side costs can greatly reduce overall construction costs for sites along highways. We also find that grid-connected DCFC design are substantially cheaper than off-grid solar powered DCFC with onsite storage.}

The expansion of EV ownership will include both changes in where the vehicles are owned and how they are used and charged. This paper demonstrates methods to predict where the expansion of EV ownership is most likely to occur under current market characteristics and allows for testing of scenarios of future characteristics. These methods are demonstrated with an analysis of California, U.S., using a scenario of 4 million battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and 1 million plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), to match the state’s goal of 5 million zero-emission vehicles by 2030. These projections are combined with a model for charging behavior to generate scenarios of demand for charging away from home under various fleet characteristics and identify areas of the state with the greatest need for infrastructure investment.}

It is formally defined in the Society of Automotive Engineers J2841 standard and denotes the fraction of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) on electricity (eVMT). Using year-long driving and charging data collected from 153 PHEVs in California with 11–53 miles range, this article systematically evaluates what aspects of driving and charging behavior causes observed UF to deviate from J2841 expectations. Our analyses indicated that charging behavior, distribution of daily VMT, efficiency of electrical energy consumption in the charge depleting (CD) mode, and annual VMT were the major factors contributing to the disparities between observed and expected UF. The direction and magnitude of their individual effect varied with the vehicle type and range. Approximately ±45\% of deviations from J2841 UF is attributable to the observed charging behavior. Differences in daily VMT distribution were responsible for −20\% to +3\% of deviation. Annual VMT and effective CD range achieved on-road influenced the UF deviation by ±25\% and −20\% to −4\%, respectively.}

abstract = {Summary
The cost to charge an electric vehicle (EV) varies depending on the price of electricity at different charging sites (home, workplace, public), vehicle use, region, and time of day, and for different charging power levels and equipment and installation costs. This paper provides a detailed assessment of the current (2019) levelized cost of light-duty EV charging in the United States, considering the purchase and installation costs of charging equipment and electricity prices from real-world utility tariffs. We find national averages of $0.15/kWh for battery EVs and $0.14/kWh for plug-in hybrid EVs in the United States. Costs, however, vary considerably (e.g., $0.08/kWh to $0.27/kWh for battery EVs) for different charging behaviors and equipment costs, corresponding to a total projected fuel cost savings between $3,000 and $10,500 compared with gasoline vehicles (over a 15-year time horizon). Regional heterogeneities and uncertainty on lifetime vehicle use and future fuel prices produce even greater variations.},

To represent the total contribution of both of these fuels to the operation, energy use, and environmental impacts of PHEVs, researchers have developed the concept of the utility factor. As standardized in documents such as SAE J1711 and SAE J2841, the utility factor represents the proportion of vehicle distance travelled that can be allocated to a vehicle test condition so as to represent the real-world driving habits of a vehicle fleet. These standards must be used with care so that the results are understood within the context of the assumptions implicit in the standardized utility factors. This study analyzes and derives alternatives to the standard utility factors from the 2001 National Highway Transportation Survey, so as to understand the sensitivity of PHEV performance to assumptions regarding charging frequency, vehicle characteristics, driver characteristics, and means of defining the utility factor. Through analysis of these alternative utility factors, this study identifies areas where analysis, design, and policy development for PHEVs can be improved by alternative utility factor calculations.}

ABSTRACT = {A significant disadvantage of battery electric vehicles compared to vehicles with internal combustion engines is their sharply decreased driving range at low temperatures. Two factors are primarily responsible for this decreased range. On the one hand, the energy demand of cabin heating needs to be supplied by the vehicle’s battery since less waste heat is available from the powertrain, which could be used to cover heating demands. On the other hand, a limited capability to recuperate at low temperatures serves to protect the battery from accelerated aging, which ultimately leads to less energy regeneration. This paper analyzes the impact of both factors separately on a battery electric vehicle’s driving range. Additionally, this paper provides technical requirements for the implementation of an electrothermal recuperation system. Such a system has the potential to reduce the impact of both abovementioned factors on driving range by enabling the direct usage of regeneratable energy for heating when battery charging is limited under cold conditions. The presented analysis is based on BMW i3 and Tesla Model 3 datasets, which combined cover more than 125 trips in and around Munich at different ambient conditions. The results show that the range can decrease by up to 31.9% due to heating and by up to 21.7% due to limited recuperation, which gives a combined maximum range decrease of approximately 50% under cold conditions. Additionally, it was found that a heater with a short reaction time in the lower millisecond range and a power capability of 20 kW would be sufficient for an electrothermal recuperation system to enable the utilization of unused regenerative braking potentials directly for heating.},

ABSTRACT = {Changes in the mobility patterns have evoked concerns about the future availability of certain raw materials necessary to produce alternative drivetrains and related batteries. The goal of this article is to determine if resource use aspects are adequately reflected within life cycle assessment (LCA) case studies of electric vehicles (EV). Overall, 103 LCA studies on electric vehicles from 2009 to 2018 are evaluated regarding their objective, scope, considered impact categories, and assessment methods&mdash;with a focus on resource depletion and criticality. The performed analysis shows that only 24 out of 76 EV LCA and 10 out of 27 battery LCA address the issue of resources. The majority of the studies apply one of these methods: CML-IA, ReCiPe, or Eco-Indicator 99. In most studies, EV show higher results for mineral and metal resource depletion than internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV). The batteries analysis shows that lithium, manganese, copper, and nickel are responsible for the highest burdens. Only few publications approach resource criticality. Although this topic is a serious concern for future mobility, it is currently not comprehensively and consistently considered within LCA studies of electric vehicles. Criticality should be included in the analyses in order to derive results on the potential risks associated with certain resources.},
