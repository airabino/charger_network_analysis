abstract = {A new model of centrality is proposed for networks. The centrality measure is based on the “information” contained in all possible paths between pairs of points. The method does not require path enumeration and is not limited to the shortest paths or geodesies. We apply this measure to two examples: a network of homosexual men diagnosed with AIDS, and observations on a colony of baboons. Comparisons are made with “betweenness” and “closeness” centrality measures. The processes by which structural changes in networks occur over time are also discussed.}

abstract = {This paper presents a literature review of studies that investigate infrastructure needs to support the market introduction of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). It focuses on literature relating to consumer preferences for charging infrastructure, and how consumers interact with and use this infrastructure. This includes studies that use questionnaire surveys, interviews, modelling, GPS data from vehicles, and data from electric vehicle charging equipment. These studies indicate that the most important location for PEV charging is at home, followed by work, and then public locations. Studies have found that more effort is needed to ensure consumers have easy access to PEV charging and that charging at home, work, or public locations should not be free of cost. Research indicates that PEV charging will not impact electricity grids on the short term, however charging may need to be managed when the vehicles are deployed in greater numbers. In some areas of study the literature is not sufficiently mature to draw any conclusions from. More research is especially needed to determine how much infrastructure is needed to support the roll out of PEVs. This paper ends with policy implications and suggests avenues of future research.}

abstract = {A national network of DC Fast Charging infrastructure (DCFC) corridors can facilitate connectivity and long-distance travel using battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Optimal locations of such facilities are where BEV drivers have easy access to charging where drivers will not have to make any deviation from their pre-planned trips. Such optimally located corridor DCFCs are usually in remote, underserved communities and immediately next to a highway where they lack the advantages of shared utility infrastructure in an urban setting. Therefore, we find that other studies and industry knowledge of infrastructure investments do not apply to corridor DCFC locations. This study evaluates the full project costs of installing and commissioning 54 DC Fast Chargers in 36 sites located in major transportation corridors in California and finds significant variation in costs between them. While existing studies show costs ranging from $20,000 - $150,000, we find costs range anywhere between $122,000 and $440,000. This data is critical for new investment in the U.S. to construct a national charging network of DC Fast charging corridors. We find that a significant proportion of the full project costs are taken up by on site “make-ready infrastructure” costs that vary greatly due to site-specific factors and design choices. DCFC installations should be considered civil construction projects with significant electrical infrastructure planning and installation that requires the cooperation of many local stakeholders. We find that costs can be greatly reduced by working with local electrical utilities early in the design and site selection stages when possible. Our study finds that some cost shift towards utility side costs can greatly reduce overall construction costs for sites along highways. We also find that grid-connected DCFC design are substantially cheaper than off-grid solar powered DCFC with onsite storage.}

abstract = {A review of accessibility measures is presented for assessing the usability of these measures in evaluations of land-use and transport strategies and developments. Accessibility measures are reviewed using a broad range of relevant criteria, including theoretical basis, interpretability and communicability, and data requirements of the measures. Accessibility impacts of land-use and transport strategies are often evaluated using accessibility measures, which researchers and policy makers can easily operationalise and interpret, such as travelling speed, but which generally do not satisfy theoretical criteria. More complex and disaggregated accessibility measures, however, increase complexity and the effort for calculations and the difficulty of interpretation. The current practice can be much improved by operationalising more advanced location-based and utility-based accessibility measures that are still relatively easy to interpret for researchers and policy makers, and can be computed with state-of-the-practice data and/or land-use and transport models. Research directions towards theoretically more advanced accessibility measures point towards the inclusion of individual's spatial–temporal constraints and feedback mechanisms between accessibility, land-use and travel behaviour. Furthermore, there is a need for theoretical and empirical research on relationships between accessibility, option values and non-user benefits, and the measurement of different components of accessibility.}

Since then considerable academic work has gone into the development of accessibility measures, but their use in transportation planning is not yet pervasive. In this essay, I reflect on why progress toward the wholesale adoption of an accessibility-oriented approach in planning practice has been slow, review some of the promising efforts in recent years that suggest that transportation planning may be on the cusp of an accessibility era, and offer thoughts about the power of the accessibility concept as a framework for thinking about the urban environment.}

It is shown that such a relationship has important consequences for urban planning.},

It is also shown that the highway network has a heavy tail even though the road network is a rather uniform and homogeneous one. Compared to the highway network, air and public ground transportation establish inhomogeneous systems and have power law behaviors.}

abstract = {This paper analyses user preferences related to electric vehicle (EV) charging decisions. The analysis includes both a qualitative as well as a quantitative assessment. The qualitative assessment consists of a literature review of existing studies about EV charging behaviour and an analysis of semi-structured interviews with Danish EV users. This assessment identifies the most relevant factors for charging. In addition, it highlights that the time horizon of the charging decision is an essential factor. We use this to design two stated-choice (SC) experiments explicitly taking these findings into account. The first SC experiment looks into long-term decisions related to regular charging practices. The second SC experiment captures decisions related to occasional charging needs on longer trips. The SC data consist of three responses from 558 EV owners for each of the two experiments. We model the data using mixed logit models to allow for unobserved heterogeneity and the repeated nature of the SC data. The main findings indicate a high preference for all-inclusive/flat fee pricing structures. Moreover, they show that respondents value interoperability between charging networks, both nationally and internationally. Related to occasional charging, we find willingness-to-pay measures describing the detour respondents are willing to drive to obtain lower costs, a higher likelihood of available chargers, and facilities at the charging location. Overall the analyses highlight many factors that influence the charging decisions of consumers that are relevant for policymakers and charging operators. In addition, they highlight the barriers in a charging context, such as network roaming, lack of charging etiquette, and congestion at chargers.}

A heuristic approach to deriving idealised charging schedules from over 39,000 week-long travel diaries from the UK National Travel Survey is presented in order to quantify the expected convenience parity — the point at which EV charging and ICEV fuelling are of comparable convenience — for combinations of battery capacity, charger power and access to charging at different locations (home, workplace and public destinations). It was found that although the majority — up to 95% — of individuals who can charge at home are expected to be able to reach convenience parity with battery sizes currently available in EV models at the ‘affordable’ end of the market, this is significantly less likely for those who rely on workplace or public charging — and particularly for those who must rely solely on en route charging. These individuals are expected to suffer considerable inconvenience associated with EV charging relative to ICEV fuelling, and although greater battery capacities and charger power ratings are expected to lessen this inconvenience, there remains a significant gap in the convenience of EV ownership between those who can charge while parked at home and those who cannot. Further analysis is carried out to long journeys that cannot be made on a single charge; ‘range anxiety’ being a major obstacle to widespread EV adoption. It was found that if drivers are compliant with the UK Highway Code in taking regular breaks on long journeys, fewer than 0.01% of trips are expected to be delayed by charging when using battery capacities of 40–60 kWh.}
