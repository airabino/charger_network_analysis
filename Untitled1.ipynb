    "This notebook shows how supply sensitive routing works using a randomly generated graph. The core concepts are outlined in the associated paper. In this notebook, a random graph containing places and stations is generated. First a generic example is given where routing is done purely to minimize travel time. Second, a case including vehicle and station parameters is generated and run."
