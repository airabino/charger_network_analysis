\section{\gls{evse} Entropy Maximization}

\gls{evse} location optimization is a topic which has produced, continues to produce, and will continue to produce ludicrous volumes of research very little of which informs deployment in any real way. This situation is the result of the fact that \gls{evse} infrastructure is insufficient in many ways and is perceived to serve as a impediment to \gls{pev} sales growth meaning that the large body of optimization and data analysis focused researchers are able to fund projects and publish papers related to the topic. In the most general sense, optimization of \gls{evse} locations is not an especially unique problem and most seek to optimize the allocation of scarce development resources to minimize a given cost function. A common theme of these papers is the goal of optimizing efficiency in metrics which are either business or consumer oriented. Robustness is often treated as a constraint if considered at all. This line of thinking has led to large concentrations of \gls{evse} in those areas most dense with \gls{pev} ownership and a number of subsidized charging stations located at arbitrary intervals along major transportation corridors.
